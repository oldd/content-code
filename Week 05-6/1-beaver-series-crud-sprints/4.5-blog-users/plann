this app continues from the blog with comments in 4.
copy paste it in here and you'll be refactoring it:
	0 - overview:
		the index page will now contain a list of users.  the current user will be highlighted in a different color.  
		when a not current user is clicked, it is set to current and the current current-user is set to false.  
		when the current user is clicked, that user's 'current' is set to false and there is now no current user.
		when a new post is written, the author is automatically set to the current user.
		if there is no current user, the author is set to 'anonymous'
	1 - build a user model object. you can test it in a separarate js file, no need to build it in you app
		user schema: {
				name: 'string',
				current: boolean,
				id: number
			}
		model.changeUser
			args: an id
			return: your call
			behavior: switches the selected user's current to the oposite of its value.  if it is setting a false to true, it will search the database (findBy) to switch the current current-user to false
	2 - create a CRUD router file for accessing the users model.
	3 - modify your index page to
		display all users, the current user is a different color.
		each user is also a button with actions that direct to the user CRUD handlers
	4 - modify the createPost handler
		it will now automatically set the author based on the current user
