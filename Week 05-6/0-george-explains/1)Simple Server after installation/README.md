Steps to make a Node app
==========================================================================
1)Go to your command line and navigate to the folder you are willing to build your project.Then initiate the project: <code>npm init</code>.

2)After you answer Node's questions, go to your console and type <code>dir</code> on Windows or <code>ls</code> on Mac-Linux and you will see that you have a folder name <b>package.json</b> created.

3)Now go and make a new file(from console or text editor) and call it app.js or index.js(some developers call it server.js but that is for later consideration)

4)After you finish setting up your application's entry point, go to console, and type <code>node app.js</code> or <code>node app</code> or in general type <i>node</i> followed by the name of your application's entry point.

The problem with our first app, (app1) is that it can only handle text,let's change that
