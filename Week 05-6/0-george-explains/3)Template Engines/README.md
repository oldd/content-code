**Why another template engine?
===============================================================================
In the world of Web Development what matters most is to be able and master some specific languages and frameworks.But that does not mean that you should stick to one and only.Languages(Java, C#, C++, Python etc) are more future proof but frameworks,libraries and even template engines are not like that.Those technologies are good as long as they can make you productive and able to deliver the result you want.So as a take away from this module you understand that whenever you see a new technology,fear not, go slowly,read the documentation and you will eventually understand that it is just another tool you can use to make your life easier if needed.
Lastly,be brave using one or another templating engine (or module in general) but also consider how well maintained it is, how active itâ€™s comunity is, and what the people you work with use.

**Why not just plain HTML then?
===============================================================================
Because by using a Template Engine like Pug,HBS or EJS we can pass data to the FrontEnd and also we can even use conditionals(IF statements), loops and basically whatever we want in order to make our application dynamic.
