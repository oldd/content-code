#### Protect Route

Continue yesterday's exercises by protecting the home route from not signed in users. If that happens the user will be redirected to the sign In page. You will also create a signOut route.

**API:**

Method | URL      | Action
---      | -------- | ------
GET    | /signout | Get Sign Up form & error messages
POST   | /signOut | Log User Out
GET    | /        | Only show infor if user is logged in
