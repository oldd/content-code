#### SignUp User

This week you will create an authentication system from stratch; that means SignUp, SignIn, SignOut & a way to check if the user is signedIn. Today you only need to create a signUp page; Very important is that you set the validations for the email and password's.
1. The password should be at least 8 characters
2. The email should look like an email
3. Both email & password must be required
4. The email must be unique and not shared with any other user

Once the user has been registerd, redirect the user to the home page where you will show the user's email, password, and sessionID. You can follow the example in [http://elium-athentication-complete.herokuapp.com/]. Moreover you should alert the user with a message if password and/or email are incorrect. Finally add a route ```/clean``` to remove all user's records from the collection. This will be called at each time we start the test to reset the initial conditions.

**API:**
